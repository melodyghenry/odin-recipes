    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One large butternut squash</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 8 oz. block of Feta</li>
        <li>1 lb of pasta with folds, such as Rotini</li>
        <li>10 sage leaves, minced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F</li>
        <li>Toss butternut squash with olive oil, 2 pinches of salt and a
            few cracks of fresh pepper. </li>
        <li>Place the squash in a baking dish and put the block of feta in the middle. 
            Drizzle the feta with a little bit of olive oil and a fresh crack of pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once 30 minutes has passed, take the butternut squash and feta out of the oven. Move around
            the squash gently to ensure it is not burnt at the bottom, but do not touch the feta. </li>
        <li>Turn the oven heat up to 450°F and bake for 5-10 more minutes, until the feta begins to 
            brown.</li>
        <li>Boil 1 lb. of pasta in salty water. Once it is al dente, strain and save 2 cups of the pasta
            water.</li>
        <li>Once the feta is browned, remove the baking dish from the oven. Immediately stir in minced
            garlic, minced sage leaves, and honey. Now add the pasta and 1 cup of pasta water and stir 
            everything together.
        </li>
        <li>If the pasta seems dry, add a bit of water, little by little, until the sauce is creamy and 
            smooth. Season with more salt and pepper, adding more honey if needed.</li>
    </ol>
